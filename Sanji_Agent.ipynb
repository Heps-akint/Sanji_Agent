    "Below is my project where I create a simulated cooking environment where an RL agent learns the correct sequence of steps (i.e. a recipe) to complete a task. The project uses a Deep Q-Network (DQN) algorithm implemented in PyTorch. The environment is designed as a sequential task where the agent must choose the correct action at each stage of a recipe. In this case the “recipe” is defined as a fixed sequence of steps. Each correct action moves the agent to the next step and yields a positive reward, while any incorrect action incurs a penalty and may reset progress. This is analogous to how, in nature, a foraging animal learns a reliable route by trial and error to obtain food—each step is verified against the known path and errors lead to re-learning the route.\n",
    "\n",
    "The design of this project follows key principles of reinforcement learning (RL). First, the environment is formulated as a Markov Decision Process (MDP) with discrete states and actions. Second, the DQN algorithm is used to approximate the Q‑function; this approximates the value of each action in a given state. The use of a replay buffer helps break correlations between consecutive samples and stabilises training, much like how natural systems learn by replaying past experiences during sleep."

    "1. **Episode Number (e.g. Episode 1/1000, Episode 2/1000, …):**  \n",
    "   This indicates which training episode is being executed out of the total (here, 1000). In reinforcement learning, one episode is like one complete “attempt” at solving the task—much as an animal might try a new route from its nest each day.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Steps:**  \n",
    "   The number of steps is the count of actions the agent took during that episode. For example, “Steps: 3” means the agent took 3 actions before the episode terminated. A higher step count in an episode might indicate that the agent was able to proceed further in the task before failing or completing it.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Loss:**  \n",
    "   This is the training loss computed during that episode (often a combination of policy and value losses). Early on, the loss might be zero or very low because the agent is taking random actions or because there is not enough experience to make the network error significant. Later, when learning begins to kick in, you start seeing nonzero loss values. In our output, the loss starts at 0.0000 and later becomes a very small positive value (for example, 0.0004 or 0.0124). This loss tells you how far off the network’s predictions are from the targets.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Epsilon:**  \n",
    "   Epsilon is the exploration rate in an epsilon‑greedy policy. It starts high (close to 1), meaning the agent takes many random actions. Over time, epsilon decays (e.g. from 0.9950 to around 0.0816 by episode 500) as the agent begins to rely more on what it has learned. This decay is key to shifting from exploration (trying new things) to exploitation (using learned behavior), a concept discussed in reinforcement learning literature.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Average Reward and Success Rate:**  \n",
    "   At the end of training, you see “Average Reward: 3.8829” and “Success Rate: 98.35%.” The average reward is computed over all episodes and gives you a summary of how much reward the agent is receiving on average per episode. The success rate of 98.35% means that in 98.35% of the episodes, the agent reached a terminal state that is considered a “win” (or at least a successful completion of the task)."
